# Brisphere Workation Platform Getting Started with Create React App and Redux

   Brisphere is a workation platform that enables people with remote jobs to travel and work simultaneously. This project is a fully responsive website built using React js and optionally TypeScript, with Redux Toolkit integration for state management. It includes an order form for booking a stay in Ladakh, as well as dynamic navigation between pages and interactive features.
   This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

# Features
 -> Responsive Design: The layout adjusts to various screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
 -> Booking System: Users can select check-in/check-out dates, number of rooms, and see calculated costs. The booking button navigates to the Order Form page.
 -> Order Form and Confirmation: Users can enter their details in an order form. Upon clicking the payment button, they are navigated to an Order Complete page.
 -> Discover Section with Read More: The Discover section includes a "Read More" functionality that toggles between a short description and a full description of the destination.
 -> Service Details: Information on various services offered at Brisphere, such as high-speed internet, transportation, and rental services.
 -> Footer with Contact Information: Provides location and contact details for Brisphere.
# Technologies Used
  React for building the user interface
  TypeScript (optional, can be replaced with JavaScript if preferred)
  Redux Toolkit (optional, used for state management in the Order Form)
## Usage
# Navigation
  Home Page: The main page, including an introduction to Ladakh, a Discover section with expandable descriptions, and a Services section.
  Order Form Page: After clicking the Book button, users are taken to the order form page where they can enter their details.
  Order Complete Page: After submitting payment on the order form page, users are directed to the order confirmation page.

# Order Form and Order Complete Pages
 - Order Form Page: Users fill out their booking details. Redux Toolkit can optionally manage the form state for a smooth experience.
 - Order Complete Page: After clicking the Payment button, users are redirected to this page to confirm their booking.
# Notes
Redux Toolkit: State management is optional but recommended for handling form data across components.
JSONPlaceholder: Used for simulating API calls for demonstration purposes.

# CSS for styling
  React Router for navigation between pages
  Fake API calls using jsonplaceholder.typicode.com to simulate server interactions

# Installation
Clone this repository:
git clone (https://github.com/ChetanPalade/Brisphere_Marketsq.io_chetanpAssign.git)

# Navigate to the project directory:

cd brisphere-

# Install dependencies:
npm install

# Start the development server:
npm start

The website should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
